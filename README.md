You need more Hazel in your life.

## How do I get more Hazel?

You'll need a [Tumblr API key][Tumblr API key] for this.

```
export GETHAZEL_API_KEY="ZSOm9H00sDNcqZDoSrKt5LwDhHdDrw1gWF2nKIHkgezBhOD6gP" # No, that's not a real key.
mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3) gethazel
pip install git+git://github.com/reillysiemens/gethazel.git@master
