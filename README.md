# Get Hazel

You need more Hazel in your life.

## How do I get more Hazel?

```
mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3) gethazel
pip install git+git://github.com/reillysiemens/gethazel.git@master
gethazel
```

## Why is it so slow?
My sincere apologies. I haven't bothered to work on **Hazel in Parallel** yet.
